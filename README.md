Hosting an application like NGINX inside a VM through a **CI/CD pipeline** involves automating the deployment of the VM, its configuration, and ensuring that the application is accessible externally. Here's how it all connects:



### 1. **What "Application is Hosted" Means**
- When we say an application like NGINX is "hosted," we mean:
  - It is installed on a server (in this case, an Azure VM).
  - It is running as a service on that server.
  - External users can access it via HTTP or HTTPS over the public IP or a domain name.
  
  For example, browsing to `http://<public-ip>` should show the NGINX default page or a custom web page served by the NGINX server.



### 2. **Role of CI/CD Pipeline in Application Hosting**
A CI/CD pipeline automates repetitive tasks in deploying and managing infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. Here's how the pipeline ties into hosting NGINX on a VM:

#### **Pipeline Flow**
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - The pipeline runs Terraform scripts to create Azure resources like:
     - Virtual Network, Subnet, Security Groups.
     - VM with necessary settings (size, disk, SSH keys).
     - Public IP for external access.
   - These steps ensure the environment is ready for hosting the application.

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - As part of the pipeline, the VM is provisioned with a **custom script** (via `custom_data`) that:
     - Installs the application (e.g., `apt-get install nginx` for NGINX).
     - Configures the application if needed.
     - Starts the service (`systemctl start nginx`).

3. **Validation**:
   - After deployment, the pipeline can include validation steps to:
     - Check if the application is running (`curl http://<public-ip>`).
     - Verify that the correct content is being served (e.g., custom web pages or APIs).

4. **Environment-Specific Logic**:
   - For DEV, UAT, or PRD environments, the pipeline can:
     - Deploy different versions of the application.
     - Use separate VMs, networks, or regions.
     - Perform health checks or smoke tests before moving to the next environment.

5. **Destroy or Rollback**:
   - If you choose to destroy infrastructure (via a pipeline input), the pipeline can clean up resources, stopping the hosted application.



### 3. **How NGINX is Exposed**
- **Firewall Rules (NSG)**:
  - Ensure that port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) is open for external traffic in the Network Security Group (NSG).
  
- **Public IP Address**:
  - The public IP assigned to the VM ensures that external users can reach the NGINX service.
  
- **DNS/Domain Configuration**:
  - (Optional) A custom domain can point to the public IP for better accessibility (e.g., `my-app.com` instead of an IP address).

### 4. **Validating the Hosting**
After the pipeline runs:
1. Retrieve the **public IP** from the Terraform output (or pipeline logs).
2. Open a browser and visit `http://<public-ip>`.
3. You should see the default NGINX page or your custom web page if configured.
